				<h2>COVID-19 Journal, 14 April 2020</h2>
				<p>
          Today is April 14. This coronacation is boring. I remade the "Anybody Have a Map?" MIDI file, because I found
          another platform that i like better, and it does the sheet music at the same time. I also completed "Waving 
          Through A Window", and I've started on "For Forever". I am planning to redesign this site soon, but HTML is a 
          pain in the buttocks. It's fun though. Here is some HTML.
          <br>
          <code>
            <!doctype html>
            <html>
              <head>
                <meta charset="utf-8">
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="alex.css">
                <title>Sample Website</title>
             </head>
             
             <body>
               <h1>Sample Website</h1>
               <p>This is a sample website</p>
             </body>
            </html>
           </code>
           <br>
           That might not have worked. Oh well. See you later!
