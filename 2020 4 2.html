				<h2>COVID-19 Journal, 2 April 2020</h2>
				<p>Today is April 2nd. My birthday is in 3 days!! We have been out of school for 
					3 weeks so far, and I am already bored. So far, we have dug up treasure, grew
					crystals, made cards, made new signs for our baskets, and sat on our behinds.
					Governer Whitmer just issued a "State of Disaster", and cancelled school for
					the rest of the school year. I don't know if I'll survive being stuck at home
					for 5 months.
