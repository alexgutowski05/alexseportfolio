				<h2>COVID-19 Journal, 7 April 2020</h2>
				<p>
          Today is April 7nd. My birthday was 2 days ago. It wasn't great, because I 
          couldn't go anywhere. The other day I finished turning "Anybody Have A Map?" 
          from Dear Evan Hansen into a MIDI file for 
          <a href="https://www.dearevanhansenfilm.com" target="_blank">my animated version of Dear 
          Evan Hansen.</a> If you want to listen to it you can find it 
          <a href="https://www.dearevanhansenfilm.com/Anybody%20Have%20A%20Map.mid.mp3" target="_blank">here</a>.
          Now I am creating vocal sheet music for the song, because unlike my Imagine Dragons 
          songbooks, the Dear Evan Hansen songbook does not have a vocal track, so I have to 
          create that. Our teachers gave us crap to do over "Coronacation", so I'm sad now.
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm going to be done now. See you in a few days!
