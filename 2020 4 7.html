				<h2>COVID-19 Journal, 7 April 2020</h2>
				<p>
          			Today is April 7nd. My birthday was 2 days ago. It wasn't great, because I 
          			couldn't go anywhere. The other day I finished turning "Anybody Have A Map?" 
          			from Dear Evan Hansen into a MIDI file for 
          			<a href="https://www.dearevanhansenfilm.com" target="_blank">my animated version of Dear 
          			Evan Hansen.</a> If you want to listen to it you can find it 
          			<a href="https://www.amgutowski.com/sheetmusic/dearevanhansen/wav/anybodyhaveamap.wav" target="_blank">here</a>.
         		 	Now I am creating vocal sheet music for the song, because unlike my Imagine Dragons 
          			songbooks, the Dear Evan Hansen songbook does not have a vocal track, so I have to 
          			create that. Our teachers gave us crap to do over "Coronacation", so I'm sad now.
          			<br>
          			<br>
          			I'm going to be done now. See you in a few days!
