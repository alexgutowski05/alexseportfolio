				<h2>COVID-19 Journal, 2 June 2020</h2>
				<p>
          Today is June 2nd, 2020. Dad yelled at me yesterday because I opened his old computer and now it doesn't work. He says 
          I broke the AIO pump, but the only way I could have broken it is if I opened the pump, which I didn't do. He's pissed.
          <br>
          <br>
          I finished <a href="https://www.dearevanhansenfilm.com/forforever.mp3">"For Forever"</a>, and now I'm working on "Sincerely, Me".
          <br>
          <br>
          I'm running out of things to say.
