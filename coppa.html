          <h3 id="whatiscoppa">What is COPPA?</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            COPPA, or the Children's Online Privacy Protection Agency, is managed 
            by the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov">FTC</a>. But what is COPPA? Well, 
            I don't blame you for not reading the 44 page long document, 
            <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/2012-31341.pdf">Federal Register Volume 17, Number 12</a>, 
            but here is a quick summary.
            <br>
            <br>
            The COPPA law was created in 2013 as a way to protect children's information 
            online. When you look something up, say a toaster, your web browser saves 
            that and will give you ads based on that, so on say Reddit, you might see ads 
            for toasters. COPPA prevents services from using information to 
            customize your browsing experiance if you are under the age of thirteen.

          <h3 id="coppaonline">Where has COPPA been enforced, and how can I tell?</h3>
          <p>
            This is kind of a confusing topic. There is no list of websites that enforce 
            COPPA. In theory, every website has COPPA already, and you probally just don't 
            know it. Some sites make it obvious, and some don't, but most of them enforce 
            COPPA. A site such as <a href="https://www.instagram.com">Instagram</a> doesn't 
            allow people under 13 to create an account. You might not connect it, but this 
            is COPPA. Other sites, like <a href="https://www.neopets.com">NeoPets</a> requires 
            a parent/guardian to approve the account before the account is activated, and when 
            it is activated, it is activated as a child account, following COPPA rules. Some 
            sites might not have COPPA, but iOS, <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple's</a> 
            mobile operating system, has a COPPA feature built into it. First off, Apple won't 
            let people under 13 create an account normally. If a child wishes to use an Apple 
            device, a parent/guardian must set up Family Sharing, and create a child account 
            through their account. When a child account is created, purchaces must be confirmed 
            by an adult, and certain features in settings are locked down, and not allowed to be 
            changed. And some of these features, you guessed it, are Ad Tracking, App Analytics, and 
            "Improve" Siri<sup>1</sup> and Dictation. These can actually be disabled on a "not child" 
            account, by going to Settings > Privacy > Analytics & Improvements, and Advertising. 
            Some web browsers, like Firefox or Opera, include this by defult. Even some search engines 
            include it, from kids search engines, like <a href="https://www.kidrex.org">KidRex<sup>2</sup></a>, to
            real search engines, like <a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo<sup>3</sup></a>.

          <h3 id="youtube">Why did YouTube take so long to enforce COPPA?</h3>
          <p>
            Recently (January 2020), YouTube has updated their laws about COPPA, but why 
            <img style="float: right;" src="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/u52513/major_privacy_judgements_against_google.png" alt="Google Lawsuit Information">
            now? Why not earlier when everyone else was doing it? Well, at the beginning, 
            COPPA didn't apply to YouTube, because the YouTube terms or service prevented 
            anyone under 13 from creating an account, but recently, YouTube has been saying, 
            at trade shows, that YouTube is the number one site for kids under the age of 10. 
            Openly admitting that children are using their site caught the FTC's attention. 
            The FTC sued Google about 170 million US dollars for violating COPPA laws, for 
            both YouTube and Google Ad Services, forcing them make changes to the way they are 
            enforcing COPPA. Well, what about YouTube Kids? The problem with that is regular 
            YouTube is still avalible. Kids can still access regular YouTube! In fact, there used
            to be a button on YouTube Kids that says "Go to YouTube", before this COPPA thing!
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3 id="vimeo">Why has Vimeo not enforced COPPA?</h3>
          <p>
            Vimeo is in the same boat as most other social media platforms, because Vimeo has an age 
            restriction, so user can not create an account if they are under 13. Unlike YouTube, Vimeo
            is less popular, and they aren't boasting that they are the "number one site for kids under 10",
            so currently they are unnoticed by the FTC. That doesn't say they won't go unnoticed.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3 id="alex">What am I doing about COPPA></h3>
          <p>
            YouTube asks me everytime I post a video if it is made for kids. To be on the safe side, pretty 
            much every video I post on YouTube will be marked as "No, this video is not for kids". I will 
            only mark a video as "Yes, it's for kids" if kids appear in the video. That's it.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Thanks for reading. Here is a good video explaining COPPA in depth more.</p>
