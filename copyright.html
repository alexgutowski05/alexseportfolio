				<p>
          Ick, I have to talk aboutr legal stuff. <br>
          <br>
          Hi, my name is Alex and I run this website. Any videos I post on YouTube or Vimeo will have copyright 
          information in the description. It looks like this:
        </p>
        <code>
          Copyright &copy; 2020 Alex Gutowski <br>
          This video may be used with permission. Please visit amgutowski.com/copyright.html for more information.
        </code>
        <p>
          Now, most people don't consider me a "party pooper" or the "fun governer", but laws are laws, and I have to 
          respect them. After reading <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/title17.pdf">Title 17, Circular 92</a>
          of the United States Code, this is how I must proceed.
				</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All videos will have a copyright statement in the description</li>
          <li>
            All copyright statements will state one of four of the following
            <ol>
              <li>This video may be used with permission.</li>
              <li>This video may not be used except by the publisher and those who appear in the copyright listing.</li>
              <li>This video may not by used by anyone except for the publisher.</li?>
              <li>This video may be used without permission, giving credit in the form of "Copyright &copy; {year} Alex Gutowski".</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>If the video has statements 1 or 2 in the description, you must fill out the form below to request a copyright release</li>
          <li>If the video has statement 3 in the description, contact me directly.</li>
          <li>
            If the video has statement 4 in the description, you may use the video, IF you give credit, 
            either by placing <a href="watermark.png">this</a> overlay in the bottom left corner of the 
            video, or by writing Copyright &copy; {year} Alex Gutowski. To get a copyright symbol in HTML,
            write "&amp;copy;". To get a copyright symbol on Windows, hold 'Alt' and type 0169 on either 
            your numberpad, or your keyboard. I'm not sure how to get one on Mac or Linux. Ask Google :).
            If you do not do this, I will copyright strike you.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Thank you for taking the time to read this. If you just skipped over it, that might not pay off. 
          I will take these rules very seriously, and if I find any of my content online without my permission,
          I will copyright strike you, and request it to be taken down.
        </p>
