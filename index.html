				<h2>Welcome To My Website!</h2>
				<br>
				<p>
					My name is Alex Gutowski. I'm a Sophomore at Saline High School. I took Web Design 
					as a course last year, and we created websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I 
					am very proud to say that this website was created entirely with HTML, CSS, and 
					JavaScript, and not created by a website builder like Wix or Weebly. I tend to 
					keep my HTML very tidy, so if you view the source, it is likely to have lots of 
					empty space. Using <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a>, 
					<a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>, and 
					<a href="https://domains.google">Google Domains</a>, I am happy to say that this 
					website is (for the most part) complete.
